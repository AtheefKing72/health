                <h2>Macronutrients: The Building Blocks of a Healthy Diet</h2>
                <p>Macronutrients are the essential nutrients your body needs in larger amounts. They provide the energy your body uses for everything from breathing and moving to thinking and growing.  These macronutrients are the foundation of a healthy diet:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Protein:</strong> Protein is crucial for building and repairing tissues, including muscles, bones, skin, and organs. It's also essential for producing enzymes, hormones, and antibodies. Good sources of protein include lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, beans, lentils, tofu, tempeh, quinoa, and Greek yogurt.  Aim for a variety of protein sources to ensure you're getting all the essential amino acids.</li>
                    <li><strong>Carbohydrates:</strong> Carbohydrates are the body's primary source of energy.  They fuel your brain, muscles, and other vital organs.  It's important to choose complex carbohydrates over simple carbohydrates. Complex carbohydrates, found in whole grains (brown rice, quinoa, oats, whole-wheat bread), fruits, and vegetables, provide sustained energy and are rich in fiber, which aids digestion and promotes satiety.  Simple carbohydrates, found in refined sugars, processed foods, and sugary drinks, provide a quick burst of energy but can lead to energy crashes and weight gain.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fats:</strong> Fats are essential for hormone production, cell function, and the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K).  They also play a role in brain health and satiety.  It's crucial to focus on healthy fats found in avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish (salmon, tuna, mackerel). These healthy fats provide numerous health benefits, including reducing inflammation and supporting heart health.  Limit your intake of saturated and trans fats, which are often found in processed foods and can increase your risk of heart disease.</li>

                <h2>Micronutrients: The Tiny but Mighty Nutrients</h2>
                <p>Micronutrients are vitamins and minerals that are needed in smaller amounts but are equally vital for various bodily functions.  They play critical roles in everything from immune system support and bone health to energy production and cell growth.  A balanced diet rich in colorful fruits and vegetables is the best way to ensure you're getting an adequate intake of these essential micronutrients.  Different fruits and vegetables offer different combinations of vitamins and minerals, so eating a variety is key.  Consider incorporating a rainbow of colors into your meals to maximize your nutrient intake.</p>

                <h2>Hydration: The Elixir of Life</h2>
                <p>Water is essential for all bodily functions.  It makes up about 60% of your body weight and is involved in everything from regulating body temperature and transporting nutrients to flushing out waste products and lubricating joints.  Dehydration can lead to fatigue, headaches, decreased cognitive function, and constipation.  Aim for at least 8 glasses of water a day, or more depending on your activity level, climate, and individual needs.  Carry a water bottle with you as a reminder to stay hydrated throughout the day.  Remember that other beverages, such as herbal tea and infused water, also contribute to hydration, but water is the purest and most effective choice.</p>
